# Build DXMT's dxgi.dll (dxmt/src/dxgi) for arm64ec from the submodule source,
# with IDXGIFactory7 and EnumAdapterByLuid added (tools/patch-dxgi-factory7.py)
# and CheckInterfaceSupport's UMD version taken from D3DKMT when
# env.MADEIRA_KMT_ADAPTER = 1 (tools/patch-dxgi-umd-version.py), and ship it
# NEXT TO upstream's committed binary as app/Madeira/arm64ec-windows/dxgi-src.dll.
#
# Why: the 64-bit dxgi.dll in the bundle is a prebuilt binary upstream
# committed (9e8291e); CI never compiled it, so a change to dxmt/src/dxgi
# never reached the phone. Its factory answers only up to IDXGIFactory6, and
# GTA V Enhanced asks for IDXGIFactory7 (a4966eed-76db-44da-84c1-ee9a7afb20a8),
# gets E_NOINTERFACE, keeps a NULL factory and stops with ERR_GFX_D3D_NOD3D12
# (build 296, logs 2026-10-01 20:16 and 20:41).
#
# Upstream's dxgi.dll stays the default for every game. WineProcessBridge.m
# links dxgi-src.dll in as C:\windows\system32\dxgi.dll (and sysx64) only when
# env.MADEIRA_DXGI_SRC = 1 is set (the game's own file, or madeira.cfg), so it
# can be tried per game and dropped again without a build.
#
# Built the way DXMT's meson build does (buildtype=release: -O3 -DNDEBUG, the
# project's flags and defines, util/dxmt sources in thin archives so only what
# dxgi references is linked and in the same order, meson's default Windows
# libraries), with the llvm-mingw upstream used (20260421, clang 22.1.4),
# against an import library derived from the shipped winemetal.dll. The
# workflow runs it BEFORE the DXMT patch steps, so the sources are the pristine
# pin. To prove the recipe, the factory is also linked WITHOUT the patch
# (OUT/plain/dxgi.dll) and compared with upstream's committed dxgi.dll: the same
# symbols at the same addresses means this source build is upstream's binary
# plus the patch and nothing else (a mismatch is reported, not fatal).
#
# Any failure leaves the bundle untouched (upstream's dxgi.dll ships alone) and
# exits 1 with a ::warning::; the workflow step continues on error.
#
#   DXGI_OUT=<dir>    work directory (default build/dxmt-dxgi)
#   DXGI_NO_SHIP=1    build and check, but do not copy into the bundle
# Run from the repository root.
