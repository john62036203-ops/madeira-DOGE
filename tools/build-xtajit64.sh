# Build the ARM64EC FEX module (libarm64ecfex.dll) from the FEX submodule with
# tools/patch-fex-ios-avx.py applied and ship it as xtajit64-avx.dll, next to
# upstream's untouched xtajit64.dll. WineProcessBridge.m links it in as
# system32\xtajit64.dll only for a game whose settings turn AVX on
# (MADEIRA_FEX_AVX=1); every other game runs upstream's module.
#
# build/fex-arm64ec/build.sh does not record everything the committed DLL was
# built with; the options below reproduce it. FEX_IOS_HOST must reach the
# ASSEMBLER too: Module.S holds the iOS transition code (TEB from TPIDR, not
# x18; the FFS bypass). Builds 138-148 missed CMAKE_ASM_FLAGS, got the stock
# ExitToX64 (`str x30,[sp,#-8]!`, sp off 16-byte alignment) and every x64 DLL
# entry point crashed -- with section sizes identical, so sizes prove nothing.
# Before shipping, the unpatched source is built and compared with the
# committed DLL by function list and by the instructions of the Module.S
# transition code; any drift keeps the AVX build out. Run from the repo root.
