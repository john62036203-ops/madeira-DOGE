// Extension memory experiment (2026-09-29), shared by Madeira and its
// MadeiraMemoryHost extension.
//
// iOS 27's jetsam table gives the com.apple.ar.viewer extension point no
// memory limit (LiveContainer runs guest apps in such an extension). The
// question: memory objects created in that extension and mapped into Madeira,
// whose phys_footprint pays for them? Madeira asks the extension for regions
// of each kind below, writes every page itself, and compares both processes'
// footprints before and after.

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <xpc/xpc.h>
#import <mach/mach.h>

// <mach/mach_vm.h> is "unsupported" on the iOS SDK, but libsystem_kernel
// exports these (JITAllocator.c declares its own the same way).
